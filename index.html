        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring Software Developer who loves everything about Technology and Design. My passion with coding started when I was a teenager, playing with html on my WordPress`s blogs where I loved to write about Disneyworld and fashion. </p>
        <p>Life took me another direction and I end up getting a bachelor`s degree in Finance. My most recent and favorite job was working at a Tech Start Up in the Silicon Valley where my job was to plan and execute team building activities for employers at Google, Facebook, Twitter and other Tech Companies. I loved talking to the Software Engineers and asking about the projects and their experiences. Because my boss knew about my passion, he advised me to start on a coding bootcamp, and that’s how I decided to switch careers. I am so excited about investing my time on learning code and become a good Software Developer to be able to soon land a job in the Tech field.</p>
        <p>When I am not reading and learning about code, you can meet me at the nearest tennis courts. </p>
